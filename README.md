RecDNSTester
============

Python program to test DNS servers for recursion
This is my first program. It is probably inefficient and perhaps buggy.

```
usage: RecDNSTester.py [-h] [-v] [-host HOST] [-i IPS [IPS ...]] [-f FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -v                Display the current version of the program.
  -host HOST        Override the default DNS lookup for google.com
  -i IPS [IPS ...]  IPs that have to be scanned. Comma separated.
  -f FILE           File with IPs that have to be scanned. Separated with
                    newlines or commas.
```
